2.	A Matrix

3.	Generative Design

4.	"." is for current directory

5.	Piping

6.	a.	I found what he said about having three monitors interesting because I 100% agree exactly with what he said.
		I have three monitors and I feel like I could easily go back to two, but having at least 2 monitors makes a
		world of difference and there's no way I could go back to just one. anyone who does work on a desktop computer
		should have dual monitors.

	b.	Opportunity costs - It's really important to look at every decision you make in terms of opportunity costs,
		Even in areas other than time management. It helps to more objectively quantify the benefit and costs associated
		with making a decision and also helps with fallacious reasoning (like sunk cost fallacy).
		
	c.	Removing phone notifications - You can extend this to just removing distractions all together. If you actually
		care about getting work done, you need to remove distractions from your work space. Whenever I sit down at my computer
		to do work, I almost always sign out of steam and discord so I don't get messages and people wanting to talk because
		every time I try to both talk to a friend and do homework, it slows my progress tremendously.
